## Data Analysis from Experiments particle tracking and Molecular Dynamics simulation

There are 2 main classes of functions:

* TRAJECTORY FUNCTIONS. Deal with single-particle trajectories, with variable length in general (since particle tracking from experiments produces different-length trajectories).

* SYSTEM INSTANTANEOUS-STATE functions. Deal with system's snapshots analysis. They have variable number of particles (since particle tracking from experiments produces different-length trajectories).

Both classes of functions should be able to yield with both system-wide and local-field magnitudes.

A full (growing) list of functions will be provided in short.
